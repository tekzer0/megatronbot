The tasks described in config/HEARTBEAT.md are already complete. The file       
pages/api/heartbeat.js already exists and serves a lightweight, DB-free endpoint
that returns HTTP 200 with JSON { status: 'ok' }.                               

Therefore, no code changes are needed.

Got it. Let me know if you need any changes to the heartbeat endpoint or any    
other file.
