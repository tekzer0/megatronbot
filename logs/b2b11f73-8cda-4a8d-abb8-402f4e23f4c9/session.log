I will create a new file pages/api/heartbeat.js as described in the             
config/HEARTBEAT.md file. This new endpoint will return a 200 status with a JSON
payload of { "status": "ok" } and will not interact with the database.

pages/api/heartbeat.js
I have reviewed the config/HEARTBEAT.md and the newly added                     
pages/api/heartbeat.js file.                                                    

To complete the tasks, I will add the necessary code to pages/api/heartbeat.js  
to create the heartbeat endpoint.
