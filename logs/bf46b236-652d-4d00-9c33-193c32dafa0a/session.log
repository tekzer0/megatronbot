To complete the tasks outlined in config/HEARTBEAT.md, I will create a new API  
route file pages/api/heartbeat.js. This file will handle GET requests, return a 
simple JSON payload, and explicitly avoid importing any modules that would      
trigger database initialization or heavy work, as requested.                    

Here is the SEARCH/REPLACE block for the new file:

pages/api/heartbeat.js
It looks like the pages/api/heartbeat.js file you provided has its content      
duplicated. To complete the task as described in config/HEARTBEAT.md, I will    
remove the duplicate code, leaving a single, correct implementation of the      
heartbeat endpoint.
