I will create a new file pages/api/heartbeat.js to implement the new heartbeat  
endpoint, ensuring it remains lightweight and does not interact with the        
database, as described in config/HEARTBEAT.md.

 * tools (e.g., every few seconds) and should always return a 200 status with a 
 * minimal JSON payload.

 * IMPORTANT: Do NOT import any modules that may initialize the DB (e.g.,       
 * lib/db/, lib/tools/, etc.). Keeping this endpoint DB‑free ensures it remains 
 * fast and does not interfere with other services.
