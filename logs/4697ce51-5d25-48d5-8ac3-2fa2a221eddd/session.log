To complete the tasks outlined in config/HEARTBEAT.md, I will create a new API  
route file pages/api/heartbeat.js. This file will handle GET requests, return a 
200 status with a simple JSON payload, and include a comment explaining its     
lightweight, DB-free nature for monitoring purposes.

pages/api/heartbeat.js
You have provided the pages/api/heartbeat.js file. I will now create this file  
with the content as described in config/HEARTBEAT.md to fulfill the first three 
tasks. There are no other files to add to the chat to complete the current      
request.
