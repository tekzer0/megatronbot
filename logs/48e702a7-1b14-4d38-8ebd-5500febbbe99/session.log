I will create a new file pages/api/heartbeat.js that provides a lightweight     
health check endpoint, as described in config/HEARTBEAT.md. This endpoint will  
return HTTP 200 with a JSON payload { "status": "ok" } and will not interact    
with the database or perform any heavy operations.

Okay, since pages/api/heartbeat.js has been added to the chat, I will provide   
the SEARCH/REPLACE block to create the file with the necessary content.
