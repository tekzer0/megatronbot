I will create a new file pages/api/heartbeat.js as described in                 
config/HEARTBEAT.md. This file will handle GET requests, return a 200 status    
with a JSON payload, and include a comment about its lightweight nature.

pages/api/heartbeat.js
I understand. I have already provided the content for pages/api/heartbeat.js in 
my previous response. Now that the file has been added to the chat, I can       
provide the SEARCH/REPLACE block to populate it.                                

This change creates the pages/api/heartbeat.js file with a GET handler that     
returns a 200 status and {"status": "ok"}, fulfilling the requirements in       
config/HEARTBEAT.md.
