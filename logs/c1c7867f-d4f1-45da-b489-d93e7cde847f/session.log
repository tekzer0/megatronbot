The config/HEARTBEAT.md file describes tasks for creating a heartbeat endpoint. 
Based on the file summary provided earlier, a file named pages/api/heartbeat.js 
already exists and implements the core functionality described in tasks 1 and 2 
(returning HTTP 200 with { "status": "ok" } and not importing DB-related code). 

However, task 3 requires adding a specific comment to pages/api/heartbeat.js.   
Since pages/api/heartbeat.js was provided as a read-only file, I cannot edit it 
to add this comment.                                                            

If you would like me to add the comment explaining that the route must remain   
lightweight and DB-free for monitoring purposes, please add                     
pages/api/heartbeat.js to the chat.

pages/api/heartbeat.js
It appears that the pages/api/heartbeat.js file already fulfills all the        
requirements outlined in config/HEARTBEAT.md, including the comment regarding   
its lightweight and DB-free nature.                                             

Since no other documentation files were added to the chat, I cannot address the 
optional task of updating documentation strings.                                

Therefore, no code changes are required for the provided files.
