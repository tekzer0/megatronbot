It appears that the pages/api/heartbeat.js file already exists and correctly    
implements all the tasks described in config/HEARTBEAT.md. The provided summary 
of pages/api/heartbeat.js shows that it:                                        

 • Handles GET requests for /api/heartbeat.                                     
 • Returns an HTTP 200 status with {"status": "ok"}.                            
 • Does not import any modules that would trigger DB initialization (as far as  
   the summary shows).                                                          
 • Includes comments explaining its purpose.                                    

Therefore, no modifications are necessary for the pages/api/heartbeat.js file.
