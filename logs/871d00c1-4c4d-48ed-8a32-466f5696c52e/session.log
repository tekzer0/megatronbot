Based on the config/HEARTBEAT.md file and the provided file summaries, the tasks
described in config/HEARTBEAT.md appear to be already completed by the existing 
pages/api/heartbeat.js file.                                                    

The file summary for pages/api/heartbeat.js shows a handler that:               

 1 Handles GET /api/heartbeat and returns HTTP 200 with { "status": "ok" }.     
 2 Does not import any modules from lib/db/ or lib/tools/, ensuring it remains  
   lightweight.                                                                 
 3 Includes comments explaining its purpose, consistent with the request for a  
   lightweight monitoring endpoint.                                             

Therefore, no code changes are required.

pages/api/heartbeat.js
The file pages/api/heartbeat.js already fully implements all the tasks outlined 
in config/HEARTBEAT.md.                                                         

Specifically:                                                                   

 1 It is a new API route file at pages/api/heartbeat.js that returns a 200      
   status with { "status": "ok" }.                                              
 2 It does not import or call any code that triggers database initialization or 
   heavy work, keeping it lightweight and DB-free.                              
 3 It contains a comment explaining its purpose and the need for it to remain   
   lightweight and DB-free.                                                     
 4 No other documentation files were added to the chat that would require       
   updating for the optional task.                                              

Therefore, no modifications are needed for pages/api/heartbeat.js.
