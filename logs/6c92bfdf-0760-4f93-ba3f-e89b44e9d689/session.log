You want me to complete the tasks outlined in config/HEARTBEAT.md. This         
primarily involves creating a new API route file.                               

I will create a new file pages/api/heartbeat.js that implements a lightweight   
heartbeat endpoint as described in the config/HEARTBEAT.md document.
