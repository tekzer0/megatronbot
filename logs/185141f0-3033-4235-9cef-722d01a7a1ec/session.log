To complete the tasks, I will create a new file pages/api/heartbeat.js that     
implements the new lightweight heartbeat endpoint.

pages/api/heartbeat.js
I have reviewed the config/HEARTBEAT.md file and the pages/api/heartbeat.js     
file. The proposed pages/api/heartbeat.js file correctly implements the new     
lightweight heartbeat endpoint, sending a 200 status with { "status": "ok" } and
includes the necessary comment.                                                 

Here is the SEARCH/REPLACE block to create the pages/api/heartbeat.js file:

// This is a lightweight heartbeat endpoint for health checks.

export default function handler(request, response) {                            
  response.status(200).json({ status: 'ok' });
