It seems that a pages/api/heartbeat.js file already exists and contains the     
necessary response.status(200).json({ status: 'ok' }) as per your provided      
summaries.                                                                      

However, to fully complete the tasks outlined in config/HEARTBEAT.md, I need to 
add a comment to this file.                                                     

Please add pages/api/heartbeat.js to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

pages/api/heartbeat.js
The pages/api/heartbeat.js file you provided already fulfills all the           
requirements outlined in config/HEARTBEAT.md:                                   

 1 It is a new API route file that sends a 200 status with {"status": "ok"}.    
 2 It does not import or call any code that triggers DB initialization.         
 3 It includes a comment explaining its lightweight, DB-free nature for         
   monitoring.                                                                  

No further changes are required to complete the tasks as described.
