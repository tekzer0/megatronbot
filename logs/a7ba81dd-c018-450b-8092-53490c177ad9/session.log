To complete the tasks, I will create a new file pages/api/heartbeat.js with the 
specified content and comments.

pages/api/heartbeat.js
It appears that pages/api/heartbeat.js has been created with the content I      
previously suggested and is now present in your codebase. This fulfills the     
requirements outlined in config/HEARTBEAT.md for adding the heartbeat endpoint. 

The tasks described in config/HEARTBEAT.md are now complete. I do not need to   
propose any further changes or add any other files for this request.
