I will create a new file pages/api/heartbeat.js as described in                 
config/HEARTBEAT.md. This file will contain the /api/heartbeat endpoint,        
ensuring it remains lightweight and does not interact with the database.

Great! Since you've added pages/api/heartbeat.js to the chat, I can now apply   
the changes to create the heartbeat endpoint as described in                    
config/HEARTBEAT.md.
