I will create a new file pages/api/heartbeat.js as described in                 
config/HEARTBEAT.md to implement the heartbeat endpoint.

// This endpoint must remain lightweight and DB-free for monitoring purposes.

pages/api/heartbeat.js
The file pages/api/heartbeat.js you provided already fully implements the tasks 
described in config/HEARTBEAT.md. It correctly provides a lightweight heartbeat 
endpoint that returns {"status": "ok"} without any database or heavy operations.

Therefore, no SEARCH/REPLACE blocks are needed for pages/api/heartbeat.js.      

No other files need to be added to complete the described tasks.
